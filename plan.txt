        # Communities: Recipe Towns (Complement Network)

        # Communities: Flavor Towns (Substitution Network)
        
        # Hypothesis: 
            # Western Flavor Towns will likely correspond to Western Recipe Towns
                # This is because of the Western use of similar overlaps
            # Eastern Flavor Towns will likely NOT correspond to Eastern Recipe Towns


# Generation

    # 0. Seed Options:
            # Human Seed Choice -- I kind of know the primary ingredients I want to eat
            # Random Cuisine Choice -- I know the type of cuisine I want to eat
            # Full Random (Random Cuisine Choice Followed by Random Within-Cuisine Choice) -- "I don't care," She said.

    # 1. Only choose items within Recipe Towns of seed ingredients
    
    # 2. Embed the Ingredients and choose ingredients using Euclidean Distance 
                 #(i.e. randomly choose one ingredient from top N closest)
        
    # For both generation methods:
            # 1. Find Top N Closest Substitutable Ingredients
            # 2. With probability p, substitute current choice with one of top N chosen randomly according to edge weight in substitution network.
            
    # Analysis: How have our graphs affected this generation process?
    
    # Run generation on OCN to compare results

    # TEST FOOD PAIRING HYPOTHESIS AND ANALYZE ACCORDING TO GENERATED RECIPES FROM BOTH OCN AND UCN
        # Key vs. Filler Ingredients

        # Choose key ingredients from UCN and remaining ingredients from OCN
